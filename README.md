Data Cleaning

This repo was created for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. The course project modified data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) to create a tidier dataset for use in subsequent analysis. The repo contains four files as of 12/23/2015, including:

1. README.md:  file to explain the contents of the repo
2. tidydata.txt: tidy dataset derived from the dataset mentioned above 
3. CodeBook.md: explanation of original and modified dataset, including variable descriptions and descriptoins of analytical steps
4. run_analysis.r: R script for downloading and processing data to create tidydata.txt
